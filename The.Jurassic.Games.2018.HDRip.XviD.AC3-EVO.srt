Traduçao por Robson = KillerBee

2
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:43,230
Um veredicto surpreendente em que muitos estão chamando

3
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,273
o julgamento de assassinato mais controverso nos últimos anos.

4
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:49,525
Anthony Tucker considerado culpado de assassinato em primeiro grau.

5
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,023
Meu cliente mantém sua inocência.

6
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,563
Nós não temos nenhum comentário neste momento.

7
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:02,565
Como você pôde fazer isso com sua esposa?

8
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:15,980
Anthony Tucker, tenho a honra de convidá-lo formalmente

9
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:18,480
para participar como um concorrente neste ano de

10
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,313
Jogos Jurássico.

11
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,482
Você aceita?

12
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,150
Sim.

13
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,355
Em notícias de entretenimento, os concorrentes deste ano

14
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:39,480
para os Jogos Jurássico foram escolhidos.

15
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,023
Eu nem sequer se preocupam com os concorrentes,

16
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:43,771
Eu quero ver o anfitrião quente e que ele vai estar vestindo

17
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,313
e dizendo, isso é o que eu quero ver.

18
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,648
Ooh, eu não posso esperar!

19
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:27,980
Ele parece real, não é?

20
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,815
A areia em sua pele.

21
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,648
O sol em seu rosto, o sabor em sua boca.

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,023
Well to all of you this world is absolutely real.

23
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,688
The danger is real and the pain is real.

24
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,400
But so is the reward.

25
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,398
Oh, oh, be careful with that.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,150
I'll need you to do as I say or boom.

27
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:57,063
You all know that when you die in here,

28
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:58,482
you die for real.

29
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:02,273
All of you are in here for one reason.

30
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,940
To win your freedom.

31
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:05,775
To go home.

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,355
You can avoid the death you justly deserve by surviving,

33
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,438
by fighting, by confronting your fears

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,775
and proving your worthiness.

35
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,605
Your goal is to be the sole survivor.

36
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:21,730
Find yourself the last man or woman standing

37
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,938
and you will win a full pardon, you will go home,

38
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,940
free, alive, exonerated.

39
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,105
Now it will be tempting to kill each other,

40
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,398
there's no rules against that,

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,605
but please if you would be so kind,

42
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,605
try to leave at least some of you alive

43
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,188
for the main attraction.

44
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,107
Oh, did you feel that?

45
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,023
A few miles beyond the tree-line

46
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,105
your first objective awaits.

47
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,813
A temporary safe zone.

48
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,231
Now your collars will alert you when you arrive.

49
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,647
Red, you're too far away, yellow means

50
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,147
you're getting closer, and green means you have reached

51
00:03:56,149 --> 00:04:00,150
the safe zone and completed your first challenge.

52
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,813
Reach the safe zone in one hour or you die.

53
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:06,563
Die here in the game and as you know

54
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,731
you will die in real life by lethal injection

55
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,898
as been assigned by the state.

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,606
The pain you feel in this world will be real pain.

57
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,188
Like the real pain you inflicted

58
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,563
on those that you have killed.

59
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:21,188
Everyone understand?

60
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,606
Good.

61
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:25,481
Congratulations to you all.

62
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:28,688
As of right now, you are no longer death row inmates.

63
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,148
You are contestants on the greatest game show in the world,

64
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,023
the Jurassic Games!

65
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,063
Oh shit.

66
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:05,731
Did I mess up my hair?

67
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:06,731
No, it's good?

68
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,563
Okay.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,273
Alright guys, you ready?

70
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,106
How long until we're live?

71
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,023
Live in 10.

72
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,525
Okay.

73
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,188
Alright everyone, we're going live in three, two...

74
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:24,523
They have less than 59 minutes to reach the safe zone.

75
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,523
So sit back, try to relax and enjoy, ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:30,231
Because today is going to be a hell of a day

77
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,106
for our brave contestants.

78
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,688
So far so good.

79
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,356
I mean that lineup is gorgeous on camera.

80
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,731
I'm telling you right now we are hitting

81
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,438
all the key demographics.

82
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,898
It's a great cast.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,650
It's the best one yet.

84
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,106
Stay on the cannibal.

85
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,688
Stay outta my way, you piece of shit!

86
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,688
I'm sorry!

87
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,150
Please don't hurt me, please!

88
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:46,150
This is real!

89
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,148
I can taste you!

90
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,188
Our contestants are frantically

91
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,063
trying to find the safe zone.

92
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,981
Don't worry, I'm sure most of them will.

93
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:03,023
But in the end, nine will die and one will win.

94
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:07,063
And this year's four stages are by far the best ever.

95
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,563
Stage one.

96
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,938
The contestants must survive being hunted by hungry dinosaurs

97
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,023
long enough to find the temporary safe zone.

98
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,606
Stage two.

99
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,063
The maze.

100
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:19,648
A deadly labyrinth filled with some of our fan favorites.

101
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,856
That's right, the raptors are back this year.

102
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,731
Stage three, the minefield.

103
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,563
Tread lightly and you might walk out of this game

104
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,938
with all your limbs.

105
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,440
And our final stage this year?

106
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:38,106
You don't actually think I'm gonna give that away, do you?

107
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:41,231
Let's just say you won't be disappointed.

108
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,648
So stay tuned, fans!

109
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,233
Because the Jurassic Games start right now!

110
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,106
In the ultimate reality game show,

111
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,938
10 death row inmates must survive a virtual world

112
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,356
filled with the deadliest predators to ever roam the earth.

113
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:04,313
William Davis, guilty on 23 counts of drug-related homicide.

114
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,814
Ren Saizo, contract killer.

115
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:10,064
Guilty of the murder of a United States senator.

116
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,939
Victor Gonzalez, The Wasp.

117
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:13,397
Leader of the Hive drug cartel.

118
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,730
Guilty of 35 counts of murder.

119
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:16,730
Stephanie Rogers...

120
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:17,897
Brian, status report.

121
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,023
Games on alpha online, raptor AI online,

122
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,939
prepping game zone beta, prepping to disengage rex one.

123
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,314
Security holding up?

124
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,480
Airtight.

125
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,480
46 attempts to breach our firewall

126
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,189
but so far none successful.

127
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,398
And none will be.

128
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,148
Stay vigilant.

129
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,689
Back live in the studio in 10.

130
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:34,525
Okay.

131
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,564
We never know who, we never know when.

132
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:44,439
But sadly we had to say goodbye to Dr. Eli Franklin.

133
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,105
The first contestant to be eliminated

134
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:49,105
in this year's Jurassic Games.

135
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,939
Of course, we can't feel too sorry for him.

136
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,480
That guy liked to blow people up.

137
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,315
A lot.

138
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:14,689
What's going on with Dr. Franklin?

139
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:15,816
Dr. Franklin?

140
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:17,607
You okay?

141
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,355
God, he's so weird.

142
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:25,482
Hey wait, doc, you forgot your bag!

143
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,980
I don't know about you, but honestly

144
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:33,648
he wasn't one of my favorites anyway.

145
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,066
Only nine contestants remain.

146
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,064
Do you know where the safe zone is?

147
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:21,900
I'm lost.

148
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,566
You're next, bitch!

149
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,732
What?

150
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,650
You're kind of a pussy, aren't you?

151
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,730
I'm not here to kill anybody.

152
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,814
I'm here to kill everybody.

153
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,983
Well, not you.

154
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,107
Not yet.

155
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:16,732
Lighten up.

156
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:25,691
Come on, I think the safe zone's this way and I'm scared.

157
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,648
No more games!

158
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,689
No more games!

159
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,525
No more...

160
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,900
Live in three, two.

161
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,064
Thank you.

162
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,648
I'm here with Bailey and Andrew Tucker.

163
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,064
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.

164
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,189
Bailey, let's start with you, sweetheart.

165
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,439
How do you feel about your father

166
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,898
being a contestant on the Jurassic Games?

167
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,732
Um, this was his only chance to get out, so.

168
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,398
That's right.

169
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,898
If he wins, he will be pardoned of all of his crimes.

170
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,564
He didn't commit any crimes.

171
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,064
And he didn't kill my mom!

172
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,439
Andrew stop, we're not supposed to talk about it.

173
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,023
It's alright.

174
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,148
Your mother's death was tragic.

175
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,439
I'm very sorry she can't be with you here today.

176
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,105
Thank you.

177
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:34,439
Is there anything you'd like to say to your father?

178
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,480
Look into this camera.

179
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,732
You can send him a message.

180
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,940
Survive, Dad, please.

181
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,523
We know you're innocent.

182
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:44,605
Get him out of the games!

183
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,440
- Stop the games! - Andy.

184
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,439
No more games!

185
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,605
No more games!

186
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:50,814
No more games!

187
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,230
No more games!

188
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,689
No more games!

189
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:55,148
No more games!

190
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,564
No more games!

191
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,023
No more games!

192
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,480
No more games!

193
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,939
I can't believe they made me talk to his kids.

194
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,773
They think he's innocent.

195
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,023
What difference does it make?

196
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,230
Well, what if they found proof?

197
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:08,730
You think they'd let him go?

198
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,605
If they find proof, we'll never hear about it.

199
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:11,605
Trust me.

200
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:12,605
Let's go!

201
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:13,982
Move, move, move!

202
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,314
So how close are they?

203
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,398
The audience is getting restless.

204
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,980
A few minutes most, but they're good hunters.

205
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,230
I thought we could build tension.

206
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,480
Build tension?

207
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,898
Our viewers don't care about tension, Brian.

208
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,773
They just wanna see the contestants die horribly.

209
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,107
Spawn them closer next time.

210
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,314
And stay on Tucker.

211
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,480
The audience already is sympathetic with him.

212
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,773
Let's watch him die live.

213
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:46,857
You got it.

214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,480
So your wife.

215
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,523
She was tortured.

216
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,355
Leave it alone.

217
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:08,980
I wonder what she was thinking when she died.

218
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:11,523
Some people can just turn it off.

219
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,357
The pain.

220
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,525
I've always admired that.

221
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,939
I read your cast bio.

222
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,858
Loving daddy, good man.

223
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,648
It's clear why the world thinks you're innocent.

224
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,566
If it makes you feel any better, I believe you.

225
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:32,650
Goodie.

226
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,814
Get up!

227
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,690
I'll see you in the next round.

228
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,647
Go you little bitch.

229
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,938
Hey, you know what?

230
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,563
Can we get some wind, just to make him sway

231
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,438
a little bit?

232
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,065
Roll her package.

233
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:50,272
Bloodthirsty.

234
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,647
Merciless.

235
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,147
Psychopath.

236
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,647
Words used to describe Sarah Laforte.

237
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,981
The youngest death row inmate

238
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,231
to ever enter the Jurassic Games.

239
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,356
I had the opportunity to sit down with her

240
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:07,275
and try to get inside the head of this cold-blooded killer.

241
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,775
Sarah?

242
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,690
I just want to ask you a few questions.

243
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:32,900
Joy.

244
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,858
My friends call me Joy.

245
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,688
Why do you prefer to be called Joy?

246
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,525
Because I'm such a happy person.

247
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,400
Okay Joy.

248
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,688
What happened in your life that brought you here

249
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,357
at such a young age?

250
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,441
It's a secret.

251
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,900
Any more questions?

252
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,815
Ah, well well well.

253
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:27,398
You are still hanging in there, aren't ya?

254
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Oh come on man, come on!

255
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,731
What do you got inside ya, huh?

256
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:33,898
Are you gonna let this little girl

257
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,648
take you out of the game this early?

258
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,231
What about your kids?

259
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,688
You can't die now.

260
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,525
Jesus.

261
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,608
We must work together as long as we can.

262
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:23,148
There are things more terrible than us in this game.

263
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,150
As individuals, we don't stand a chance!

264
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,813
There may still be a way to escape

265
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,482
if we work together.

266
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,273
We must get to the safe zone.

267
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,940
We are being hunted.

268
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:44,856
There are three of them.

269
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,191
We must go, now!

270
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,981
You're not planning on using that, are you?

271
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,231
No.

272
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,691
We wouldn't want an uprising.

273
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,023
It almost sounds like you do.

274
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,731
His children, Savannah?

275
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,023
You made me interview Tucker's children?

276
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,273
Well he's trending high.

277
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,813
People want him to win.

278
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,898
It's been a while since we had one that might be innocent.

279
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,856
His children believe that he is,

280
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:40,856
and they're about to see him

281
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,688
get ripped to shreds on live TV.

282
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,231
Nobody's forcing you to be here.

283
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:49,148
There are a number of people behind you that would

284
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,813
love your job.

285
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,815
Younger, smarter, prettier.

286
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,398
They would put their first born in the game

287
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,563
to get a shot at your position.

288
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,400
I know.

289
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,731
I want to be here.

290
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:01,566
Good.

291
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,856
Oh.

292
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,563
If you ever question an assignment again,

293
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:13,025
you can go ahead and clean out your desk.

294
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,023
Oh he should be easy.

295
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,481
You want him?

296
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,316
Wait.

297
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,900
Don't be stupid.

298
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,233
Hi friend.

299
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,313
Do you happen to know which way it is to the safe zone?

300
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,563
We don't have much time to find it.

301
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,650
No, I have no idea.

302
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,108
We're lost.

303
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,563
We could die on the first challenge.

304
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,606
Wrong answer, pal!

305
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:16,650
Wait, stop!

306
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,188
The raptors have entered the canyon area.

307
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,188
What?

308
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,188
No, no no no.

309
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,023
How long until they get to them?

310
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,483
Any second now.

311
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,188
Do you know who I am?

312
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,275
I am El Avispa, The Wasp!

313
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,856
You know who I am?

314
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,273
I'm The Wasp!

315
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:44,856
I got a big stinger on my butt

316
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:48,606
and when I sting you I'm gonna die.

317
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:49,688
I think that's a bee, man.

318
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,525
Shut up!

319
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,398
I have very powerful friends.

320
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,063
Friends who can help us.

321
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,188
Help me.

322
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,107
Help me get to the end, help me win.

323
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:05,563
Why would we do that?

324
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,356
Because I can save your mother.

325
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:10,563
What do you know about my mama, huh?

326
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,773
I know all about you.

327
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,608
Trust me.

328
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,688
I can get us all out of here.

329
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,688
You will be able to see your mother again.

330
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,900
Alive and well.

331
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,438
You sack of shit!

332
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:28,233
Wait wait wait wait wait!

333
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,733
Well?

334
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,233
What are you waiting for?

335
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,065
Wait wait wait.

336
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,775
Not yet.

337
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,066
Come on!

338
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,525
What the?

339
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,398
What is happening in here?

340
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,023
Our ratings have dipped 4%.

341
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,563
Why did you stop the raptors?

342
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,773
Listen, it's called foreplay, Savannah.

343
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,731
You might wanna try it sometime.

344
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:16,275
Alright we're back in five, four, three, two.

345
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,438
That just happened.

346
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,481
Could this be an unholy alliance

347
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:25,523
between the Mason brothers and The Wasp?

348
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,063
That would be a match made in hell.

349
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:31,313
And ladies and gentlemen, I would hate to see

350
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:35,148
what that means for our other contestants.

351
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,231
Let's head back to the canyon.

352
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,938
What just happened?

353
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,857
Let's go.

354
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,066
Wait!

355
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,150
Join me.

356
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:50,563
Help me get to the end.

357
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:53,523
I can save your mother, I promise.

358
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,358
Come on.

359
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:59,813
You really think he's gonna save anybody else but himself?

360
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:02,148
How stupid could you be?

361
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,481
She's dying of cancer, no?

362
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:06,983
No one dies of cancer anymore.

363
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,438
Poor people do, you piece of shit!

364
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,273
I can pay for the treatment!

365
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,858
Okay, okay, okay!

366
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,565
We'll help you.

367
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,481
Have you lost your mind?

368
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:24,063
Haven't you seen this show before?

369
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,438
If he wins, we die, you idiot!

370
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,023
No he said he could get us out too, huh?

371
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:32,273
He knows people, right?

372
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,108
Si.

373
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:37,523
If there's even a chance that we can save Mom.

374
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:40,273
This is all bullshit!

375
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:43,606
If he knows anyone outside, then what's he doing

376
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,858
in here in the first place?

377
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,148
I want you to use your tiny little brain.

378
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,358
Think about that, ya moron.

379
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:53,481
God damnit!

380
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:54,900
God damnit, what?

381
00:25:56,733 --> 00:26:00,191
You touch him, and I'll kill you myself.

382
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,400
Okay, fine!

383
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,733
Fine!

384
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:10,441
For now.

385
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:12,525
We'll help.

386
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,688
None of them know.

387
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,023
Unfortunately, their mother, Rosetta Mason, passed yesterday.

388
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,106
Such tragedy.

389
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:42,483
But I promise that you are gonna see the raptors soon

390
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,938
because stage two, the maze, is up next

391
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,273
right here on the Jurassic Games.

392
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,563
And we're clear.

393
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:53,481
That was a good transition, right?

394
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,688
That was good.

395
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,398
Nice work.

396
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,731
I at first felt that the brothers angle was a little forced

397
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,231
but it was good drama.

398
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,731
Well, alright.

399
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,063
Hey, by the way, we gotta make sure we keep them alive

400
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:08,188
as long as possible.

401
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,773
Okay, can you imagine a Cane and Abel type of ending

402
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,148
for the finale?

403
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,563
I'm sorry to interrupt, the contestants

404
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:17,900
are approaching the safe zone right now.

405
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,063
We are close!

406
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:26,982
Keep going!

407
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,148
Objective complete.

408
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,815
Safe zone activated.

409
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,525
Go ahead.

410
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:25,858
Taste some.

411
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,148
I don't think they'd let you die of poison berry.

412
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,233
That's not very exciting.

413
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:43,106
Seems like everything in here tastes a little bit better.

414
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,898
I don't know how they do it.

415
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,733
Do you?

416
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:51,688
How would you taste?

417
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,313
Objective complete.

418
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,025
Safe zone activated.

419
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,106
Objective complete.

420
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:17,775
Safe zone activated.

421
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:42,773
What a surprise.

422
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,438
I'm Tucker, I'm innocent.

423
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,773
I'm Albert and I'm gonna eat you.

424
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:56,648
Jurassic Games action figures.

425
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,106
Available wherever fine toys are sold.

426
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,188
Tucker.

427
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,148
Joy.

428
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,273
Dr. Franklin.

429
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,231
Billy.

430
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,398
Big Brother.

431
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,398
Little Brother.

432
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,398
Stephanie.

433
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,688
Ren.

434
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,438
Collect all 10 contestants today.

435
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,563
And if you collect all 10 action figures

436
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:14,313
of this year's contestants, we will throw in

437
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:17,231
the brand new version of yours truly.

438
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,273
Complete with 10 new catchphrases.

439
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:23,563
That's right, the raptors are back this year.

440
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,023
Get yours now while supplies last.

441
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,481
Every single network is covering the games.

442
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:30,188
This is even bigger than last year.

443
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,731
Looks like a riot in Midtown.

444
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,023
Eh, nothing new.

445
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,523
They've been protesting for years.

446
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,648
Yeah.

447
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,856
We should put some of those Cavemen in the games.

448
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:38,106
Yeah no shit.

449
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:39,273
Come on.

450
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,813
We're starting the maze.

451
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:44,523
No more games, no more games, no more games!

452
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,938
Only eight remain.

453
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,023
What a cast though, huh?

454
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,608
The Mason brothers.

455
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,938
Would you take out one of your own

456
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,400
if it really came down to it?

457
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,731
We'll see.

458
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,650
We got Joy.

459
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,440
Ah, Joy, Joy, Joy.

460
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,231
I'm telling you, there is something special

461
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,813
about sweet little Joy.

462
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:21,356
Then we got Albert, the cannibal.

463
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:24,441
Albert, you make me sick.

464
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,563
In a good way, of course, because people tune in

465
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,481
just to see you die.

466
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,400
I like you.

467
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:37,063
Keep you around for our international viewers.

468
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:40,563
And then we have poor Anthony Tucker.

469
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,438
Doesn't really seem like he's cut out for this,

470
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,313
but you know what, America loves a tragic hero so I do too.

471
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:49,606
Hang in there, buddy.

472
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,441
Stephanie.

473
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,775
Oh Stephanie.

474
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,813
I'd really hate for someone or something

475
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,481
to ruin that pretty face.

476
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,773
Guess we'll have to wait for that.

477
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,775
And El Avispa, The Wasp.

478
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,188
I like you.

479
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,440
You're naughty.

480
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,940
Alright, wake 'em up, I wanna play.

481
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:32,148
Welcome, contestants.

482
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,398
I hope you are ready for your first challenge.

483
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,773
We like to call it the maze.

484
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,063
A favorite segment of the games

485
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:40,313
and our longest-running challenge.

486
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:41,856
The rules are simple.

487
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,188
Be the first to escape your chains

488
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,650
and you will be awarded this.

489
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,525
Right?

490
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:52,981
Use it to protect yourself,

491
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:54,981
use it to obliterate your enemies.

492
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,023
The choice is yours.

493
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,938
I think in the right hands, the hands of a fighter,

494
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,398
the hands of a winner, this fine piece of hardware

495
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,313
could wind up ending the game early.

496
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,856
Anything can happen in the Jurassic Games.

497
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,106
That's what makes it so much fun!

498
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,313
So here we go!

499
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:12,231
Ready in three two one go!

500
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:51,146
I got it!

501
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:52,481
You're all dead!

502
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:53,771
I win!

503
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:54,607
Game over!

504
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,983
Albert, Albert!

505
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:02,731
You have no honor if you use that now against us.

506
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,983
Shut up!

507
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:09,858
Anybody else, any last words?

508
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:19,064
Please, please don't shoot, I was kidding.

509
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:21,271
- I won't kill anybody. - Stay still!

510
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:22,521
Please!

511
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:23,481
Shoot him, what are you waiting for?

512
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:26,106
He's not gonna shoot him.

513
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,606
He's the perfect person for the gun.

514
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,774
The one that won't use it.

515
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:05,733
Move away.

516
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:40,858
Ren.

517
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,275
Go, go!

518
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:43,525
Go!

519
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,398
- There's not an exit. - What?

520
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,439
There's not a way out, they're all dead ends.

521
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,689
That way!

522
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:11,689
Where's Ren?

523
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,356
- Who? - The grate.

524
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:14,316
Get back!

525
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:19,025
Go, hurry, go!

526
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:39,525
Go!

527
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,273
Move!

528
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,108
Move!

529
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:01,731
Watch out!

530
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:10,064
We're right back where we started.

531
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:18,064
Congratulations, contestants.

532
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,356
Well done.

533
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:20,191
Stephanie.

534
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:23,648
Because you were the first to exit the maze

535
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,898
I am gonna reward you with this.

536
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,731
And not far from here you will find a crate

537
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:33,064
containing a few potentially game-changing supplies.

538
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,189
This map will help you get there safely.

539
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,856
Stephanie, you may choose to share it

540
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,733
or keep it to yourself.

541
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,358
The clock is ticking, contestants.

542
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,356
Give it to me!

543
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:50,566
Hey back off!

544
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,314
I want that.

545
00:41:58,025 --> 00:41:59,314
Hey, let her go!

546
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,273
Get off me, boy.

547
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,108
I got it.

548
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,108
Come on.

549
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:09,941
I got it.

550
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,108
Let's go.

551
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,356
Like that?

552
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:39,941
How does that feel?

553
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:44,273
First thought to have been a hoax,

554
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:46,648
Stephanie Rogers brutally murdered 16 men

555
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,439
and broadcast her kills live on the internet.

556
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,939
She spent the last three years

557
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:52,606
at the Starkweather Federal Penitentiary

558
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:55,981
prior to her acceptance in this year's Jurassic Games.

559
00:42:55,983 --> 00:42:59,314
She'll use her charms to seduce the men in the game,

560
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:02,481
just like a black widow luring them into her trap,

561
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:05,189
killing them in cold blood.

562
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:07,358
Gimme a break.

563
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:10,981
Come with me.

564
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:14,191
I have to do some fluff piece interview.

565
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,648
I'm joined now by Savannah Black.

566
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,689
She is the director of the controversial sensation

567
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:23,023
known around the globe as the Jurassic Games.

568
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:25,314
Savannah, thank you for joining us this afternoon.

569
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,898
Oh, my pleasure Jack, thank you for having me.

570
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,898
Let's begin right off the bat

571
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,689
with the morality issue here.

572
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,481
Uh, excuse me?

573
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,856
Well you know as well as anybody

574
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:34,856
the show is controversial, even still.

575
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:36,523
Are we still discussing this?

576
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:39,523
The contestants on our show are going to die anyway.

577
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,689
Now what we're doing, with the support of the government,

578
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:46,481
I might add, is giving them a chance at freedom.

579
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:47,939
But some say this is too much.

580
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,606
Isn't this really nothing more than exploitation

581
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:53,523
of these contestants for money, for ratings?

582
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:57,148
And you are essentially torturing them on live television.

583
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,731
Well I'm not concerned with a vocal minority.

584
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:02,189
A lot more people love the games.

585
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:04,523
300 million the last time I looked.

586
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,148
It's what the people want.

587
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,606
You didn't answer my question.

588
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:09,564
Well they are still dying by lethal injection.

589
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,314
- Yes, but... - Listen.

590
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,106
We didn't invent this.

591
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,606
As much as I'd like to take credit for it,

592
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,898
public execution is nothing new.

593
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,314
Think back to the days of the Roman Empire.

594
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:20,939
The gladiators fought tigers and there was

595
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:23,856
a Coliseum filled with people wanting the tiger to win

596
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,148
and most often it did.

597
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,273
Now at least on our show one of our contestants

598
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,731
is guaranteed to live.

599
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,981
What about Anthony Tucker?

600
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,564
There are a lot of folks out there who believe

601
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,564
he was wrongly convicted of killing his wife.

602
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:35,898
Well he was convicted in a court of law

603
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,523
and sentenced to death.

604
00:44:37,525 --> 00:44:39,481
And that is the only qualification required

605
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,023
to enter the games.

606
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:43,398
Oh, that and they look good on camera.

607
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,314
But wouldn't you agree having an innocent contestant

608
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,148
killed on your show does nothing more than fuel the fire

609
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,939
for groups like The Cavemen?

610
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,273
I'm not familiar with them.

611
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:51,481
You're trying to tell me you've never heard

612
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:52,981
of The Cavemen?

613
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:56,439
I am aware of a very few and extremely disorganized...

614
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:59,106
Come on, it's well-known they have promised

615
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:01,606
to disrupt the ending of this year's games.

616
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:02,981
Surely you're aware.

617
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:04,689
Well groups like that have tried before.

618
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:06,731
But our security is tight, and I am confident

619
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:09,314
that the games will go on as they always do.

620
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:10,898
Now we are approaching our next challenge

621
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,106
and your audience won't wanna miss that.

622
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:16,023
Savannah Black, thank you for joining us.

623
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:17,898
Oh, thank you Jack.

624
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,733
Asshole!

625
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:22,064
Volunteering for the games is an admission of guilt!

626
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:23,731
These aren't people, they're murderers.

627
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,023
God, I've had it up to here with The Cavemen.

628
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:27,398
People have a right to protest.

629
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,814
Okay, protesting is one thing

630
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,731
but threatening to disrupt the show's ending,

631
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:33,814
whatever the hell that's supposed to mean, is unacceptable.

632
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,648
You don't like the show?

633
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,314
Well neither do I, and do you know why?

634
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:38,773
Because there's a winner.

635
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,148
One of these lunatics gets to walk away free.

636
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,148
And it makes me sick.

637
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,066
If it were up to me they'd all be dead already.

638
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:15,025
That thing is huge.

639
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:34,273
So why did you enter the lottery?

640
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:36,523
Same reason as everybody.

641
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:37,358
Freedom.

642
00:46:40,108 --> 00:46:43,066
You really didn't do it, did you?

643
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:45,775
That's what I heard.

644
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,066
Doesn't matter much now, does it?

645
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,398
Why do you think they picked dinosaurs

646
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,398
to be the things we're running away from?

647
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,398
It tested better than robots.

648
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:06,314
Look I dunno man, gimme the map.

649
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:07,731
You don't even know how to operate it.

650
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:09,648
I don't give a damn, gimme the map!

651
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,856
Kiss my ass!

652
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:32,775
Help me!

653
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,356
He's gonna die anyway, leave his ass.

654
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,941
No, he's gonna finish, he's gonna make it.

655
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:50,941
This is it for me.

656
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:58,483
I was never gonna help you anyway, you piece of shit.

657
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:05,983
Your mom's gonna follow me to hell.

658
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,481
It's nothing.

659
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:20,689
Calm down!

660
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:21,523
I'm not playing this game anymore.

661
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:22,358
I'm done!

662
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,066
You hear me?

663
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:27,983
I quit!

664
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,523
- Put me back in my cell... - Hey!

665
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:32,358
I quit!

666
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,689
I'm not playing this game anymore!

667
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:38,398
Hey!

668
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,733
It's you and me!

669
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:41,814
It's you and me!

670
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:44,606
We gotta stay together, focus!

671
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:45,441
You focus.

672
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:47,358
Focus.

673
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,023
Well you didn't see that coming, did ya?

674
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:01,689
Our contestants are tired, they're hungry.

675
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:04,023
The Wasp is gone, but I have a feeling it's about to get

676
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,689
a whole lot tougher for our remaining six.

677
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,858
And we're clear.

678
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:12,439
How close are they to the supplies?

679
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:15,108
They're approaching right now.

680
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:18,191
The buzzards are circling.

681
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:36,773
Welcome, contestants, and congratulations on your success

682
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:38,273
and survival.

683
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,439
We're down to the final six but we seem to be missing one.

684
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:43,441
Ah, there she is.

685
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,691
The odds-on favorite to win.

686
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:48,731
I'm gonna kill you.

687
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:51,858
I sincerely doubt it.

688
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:55,689
Beyond the red barrier you will find two items

689
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:58,356
that may be of some use to you.

690
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:01,773
A knife, and, more importantly, some more ammunition

691
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:04,106
for your laser gun there.

692
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:08,358
All you have to do is just walk from here to there.

693
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,941
There are 17 mines...

694
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,273
Uh, well, maybe 20, I can't remember.

695
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:37,814
Between you and your reward.

696
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:39,064
Don't worry.

697
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,814
Stephanie's map will guide you through.

698
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:42,316
Use it to survive.

699
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:56,606
Stop the game, I'm not going through!

700
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:57,731
Stop it!

701
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,983
Come on!

702
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,983
What are you doing?

703
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,064
Come on brother, come on through, come on.

704
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:13,400
No, no, come on!

705
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,275
Come on, no, no!

706
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,650
No, god damnit!

707
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:20,691
No!

708
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:22,566
Shit!

709
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:25,900
No!

710
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,525
My brother's dead!

711
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,523
Back off, bitch.

712
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,066
Who's the odds-on favorite now?

713
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:22,439
Well there goes Cain and Abel.

714
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:23,564
I'm not gonna do another interview like that,

715
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:24,564
not during the games.

716
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:25,731
That was an ambush.

717
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:26,606
Hey, look at these ratings though.

718
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:28,106
Look at 'em.

719
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:32,273
And nice work, by the way, Brian, with the pterodactyl.

720
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:37,231
I gotta say, I am really happy with our final four.

721
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:39,606
You know Jack mentioned a direct threat from The Cavemen.

722
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:41,814
He said they're threatening to disrupt

723
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:42,898
the ending of the show.

724
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,523
Oh, The Cavemen.

725
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:46,314
What are they going to do Savannah, huh?

726
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:47,564
What are they gonna do?

727
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:48,773
Every year they say the same shit.

728
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:51,023
Every year nothing happens except for what?

729
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:52,439
More controversy.

730
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:55,939
Controversy leads to excitement, more excitement leads to

731
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,106
more viewers.

732
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,398
Hell, I love The Cavemen.

733
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,773
Status report.

734
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:01,606
Four remaining contestants are relatively close

735
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:03,314
to each other.

736
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:04,939
Shut down most of the main systems

737
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:08,439
while I load the traps and weather simulation.

738
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,689
You what, hey, hey.

739
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,731
Why don't you let 'em breathe for a minute?

740
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:14,606
Never know.

741
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,608
Maybe one of the girls'll get naked.

742
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:37,816
She's watching us, you know.

743
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:46,564
Maybe you oughta give me that clip.

744
00:53:46,566 --> 00:53:48,066
Come and get it.

745
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,689
I'd go look for her but I don't wanna leave you alone.

746
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:53,525
With him.

747
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:55,733
Smart man.

748
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,566
You move one inch closer to me and I'll gut you.

749
00:54:03,066 --> 00:54:03,900
Alright.

750
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:06,150
Alright.

751
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:12,025
It's fine.

752
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,233
You're not much older than my daughter.

753
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:04,900
I was asleep.

754
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:11,108
And I heard a noise and I went downstairs.

755
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,566
And the door had been pried open.

756
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:25,731
And I went to the kids' rooms and I made sure

757
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:28,650
they were okay, they were sleeping.

758
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,566
And then I went back to my room.

759
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,566
And I found my wife with her throat slit.

760
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:49,941
She was covered in blood and her eyes were wide open.

761
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:59,566
The murder weapon was a knife from my kitchen

762
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,731
and they said that I had pried the door open myself

763
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:06,816
to make it seem like a home invasion.

764
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:13,900
And I was convicted and I was sentenced.

765
00:56:18,983 --> 00:56:20,483
You're just a kid.

766
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:29,439
I'm gonna take you to the final two

767
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,358
and I'm gonna kill you.

768
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,233
Tucker!

769
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,398
I know you're close!

770
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,233
Tucker!

771
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,233
Tucker!

772
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:26,814
Ladies and gentlemen, it's come to my attention

773
01:00:26,816 --> 01:00:29,314
that one of our witnesses would like to share something

774
01:00:29,316 --> 01:00:30,606
with us.

775
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:39,439
He killed someone close to you, didn't he?

776
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:40,441
My husband.

777
01:00:43,108 --> 01:00:47,608
And now you feel like you finally have some closure.

778
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:51,358
Yes, yes I do.

779
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,483
Hey, hey, it's okay.

780
01:00:56,983 --> 01:00:59,898
That is a natural feeling.

781
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,733
And we all understand.

782
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,481
We're very close to finding out

783
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:08,148
who will win this year's games.

784
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,316
Don't go away.

785
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,814
Holy shit, who is this?

786
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,648
Whoa, the best actress award goes to,

787
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,648
what was your name, sweetie?

788
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,356
- Alison. - Alison.

789
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:20,439
Give it up for Alison.

790
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:21,606
She almost had me crying.

791
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:24,023
Can you believe that?

792
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:25,273
We need more of her, seriously.

793
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:26,814
Find out whoever her acting class was.

794
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,941
I'm gonna go get a drink, I'm a little emotional.

795
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:01,400
My kids.

796
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,689
If you can hear me.

797
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:07,398
I love you.

798
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,148
I'm coming home.

799
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,356
Dad!

800
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,231
Do you hear that?

801
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:13,566
I'm coming home!

802
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,608
You're not looking so good.

803
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,939
You're the one that's gonna kill me?

804
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:20,189
Oh honey, you're already dead.

805
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:31,439
We're getting immense pressure from the press

806
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:33,481
to comment on Tucker's innocence.

807
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:35,939
Okay, well here's my comment to the press.

808
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:38,398
He was sentenced to death.

809
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,814
Okay we have run the numbers

810
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,398
and it could be a ratings disaster if he dies in the game.

811
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,856
Are you out of your mind?

812
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:44,856
What do you want?

813
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,106
You know what?

814
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:50,025
Come to me live as soon as the tiger's finished.

815
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:58,606
Only two remain.

816
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:03,356
Joy, the heartless teenage killer, ruthless and crazy.

817
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,023
Who knows why, who cares?

818
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:10,189
And Tucker, a family man who callously murdered his wife

819
01:06:10,191 --> 01:06:12,191
in cold blood.

820
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:15,316
Presumed innocent by some of you.

821
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:18,150
Listen to me.

822
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,983
I am not the judge.

823
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:23,775
We are not the jury.

824
01:06:25,525 --> 01:06:26,650
But the game.

825
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,275
The game is the executioner.

826
01:06:32,483 --> 01:06:36,150
And the game decides who lives and who dies.

827
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:40,814
Uh oh, we've got a problem.

828
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:42,523
We just received an encrypted message.

829
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:43,773
From The Cavemen?

830
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:46,398
No, from here, inside the premises.

831
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,856
Open the final doorway.

832
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,148
The last challenge begins now.

833
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:14,316
I told you!

834
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:19,650
I told you I'd bring you to the final two with me!

835
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,856
Excuse me, I need to get to master control.

836
01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:38,775
Sit down.

837
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:45,064
We've intercepted an encoded transmission coming from

838
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:46,900
- the premises. - Really?

839
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:49,064
What did it say?

840
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,064
We don't know.

841
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,648
I was hoping you could tell me.

842
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:58,564
We traced the transmission back to your edit bay, Laura.

843
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,733
Have you been sending encoded messages?

844
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:05,314
I'm going to kill The Host.

845
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:06,273
On live TV.

846
01:08:07,607 --> 01:08:08,440
Tonight.

847
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:18,064
No matter what you do, the show will continue.

848
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:20,314
It's bigger than me, than you, than anyone!

849
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:23,816
You'll never...

850
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,980
Let's do this.

851
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:07,480
Patience, Tucker.

852
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:09,980
Joy, you are the favorite to win this thing, you know.

853
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:11,146
Eat shit!

854
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:12,646
That's the spirit.

855
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,189
Tucker, I'm not sure anyone expected you to get this far

856
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:19,105
but there are millions of people rooting for you out there.

857
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:23,690
In fact, we have a very special message from your kids.

858
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:26,898
Survive, Dad, please.

859
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:29,689
We know you're innocent.

860
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:30,773
Get him out of the games.

861
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:32,607
- Stop the games! - Andy.

862
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:37,275
Bring 'em back.

863
01:09:39,107 --> 01:09:41,814
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back!

864
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,566
Bring 'em back to me!

865
01:09:44,566 --> 01:09:45,398
Ow!

866
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:54,107
Why so upset?

867
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,730
We are giving you a chance to see them again.

868
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:59,564
I mean really if it wasn't for our little show here,

869
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:01,400
you'd already be dead.

870
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:05,565
And let the final challenge begin.

871
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,898
Well, this is an easy game.

872
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,564
Now you will notice that you are each chained

873
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,314
to those locks.

874
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:25,939
There are padlocks at the end of your chains

875
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:28,189
that need to be unlocked for you to cross the outer

876
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,191
finish line.

877
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:34,064
Be the first to do so, and your opponent will be eliminated.

878
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:34,900
You win!

879
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,273
The keys.

880
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,980
Excuse me?

881
01:10:38,982 --> 01:10:41,105
I don't think I quite caught that.

882
01:10:41,107 --> 01:10:43,730
Where are the keys to unlock the padlocks?

883
01:10:43,732 --> 01:10:44,855
There are two.

884
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:46,773
One for each of you.

885
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,480
Buried in the sand somewhere between

886
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:51,023
where you stand and the locks.

887
01:10:51,025 --> 01:10:54,107
Are you ready in three, two, one, go!

888
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:08,775
Tucker.

889
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:14,773
Do you know why I threw in my name for the games?

890
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:17,148
I don't care about my freedom.

891
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:20,189
Hell, being in here is as close as I could ever hope

892
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:21,358
to being free.

893
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:27,773
A girl that does things that I do won't last very long

894
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,439
in the real world anyway, you know?

895
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,523
I wanted to meet you!

896
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:38,855
Convicted killer that the whole world loves.

897
01:11:38,857 --> 01:11:40,814
The man that wanted to join the games

898
01:11:40,816 --> 01:11:44,564
so he could see his precious kids again.

899
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,064
The man that everyone cried over

900
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:47,898
when his sentence was given.

901
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,980
I mean what the hell?

902
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:50,650
You talk too much.

903
01:11:54,107 --> 01:11:56,355
She cried for you.

904
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,525
She missed you.

905
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,355
She said that you were gonna come save her

906
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,689
and I really wish you would have because I was

907
01:12:02,691 --> 01:12:04,605
so tired of waiting.

908
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:09,900
I'm here to finish what I started!

909
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:15,773
I can't let the whole world see you go free!

910
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:20,939
I'm gonna cause one more moment of chaos and heartbreak

911
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:24,191
before I leave this disgusting world!

912
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:31,314
I killed your bitch of a wife and I would do it again

913
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:34,480
and again and again

914
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:37,400
if I could!

915
01:12:38,357 --> 01:12:39,523
Yes.

916
01:12:39,525 --> 01:12:41,273
Yes, this is perfect, this is perfect.

917
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,148
This is awesome!

918
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,355
You knew?

919
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:47,065
Well, I mean, you know, we hoped.

920
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,066
See you in hell, you piece of shit!

921
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,105
What did you say to me?

922
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,357
I said I killed your wife.

923
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:04,023
What did you say to me?

924
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:05,355
Uh, give me a rex.

925
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:06,564
Bring in a rex.

926
01:13:06,566 --> 01:13:09,064
I said I killed her, ah!

927
01:13:09,066 --> 01:13:10,648
I'm gonna kill you.

928
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,939
Where, Savannah!

929
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:13,108
We need a rex.

930
01:13:14,107 --> 01:13:15,355
Will you just, where is she?

931
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,730
Do I have to do everything myself?

932
01:13:16,732 --> 01:13:18,023
Just bring it out.

933
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:19,023
Savannah!

934
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:13,189
Come on.

935
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:14,814
Oh God, get out of the way!

936
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:17,316
Let's have some fun, shall we?

937
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:03,064
What are they doing, why aren't they attacking them?

938
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:04,523
We programmed them to behave the same way

939
01:15:04,525 --> 01:15:06,480
that they would in nature and they're very territorial.

940
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:07,689
We've never had this many at once

941
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,564
so I don't know what they're gonna do.

942
01:15:08,566 --> 01:15:09,898
Well then fix it!

943
01:15:45,732 --> 01:15:48,565
Oh shit!

944
01:17:20,982 --> 01:17:21,815
Yes!

945
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,939
- Pull him out now. - What?

946
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:02,230
Whoa, whoa, Laura, what are you doing?

947
01:18:02,232 --> 01:18:03,898
Wake him up, slowly.

948
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,439
Brian, go to commercial, right now.

949
01:18:05,441 --> 01:18:07,564
No Brian, bring it here, now.

950
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,814
Laura, look at me, look at me.

951
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:11,355
This has to be some kind of a misunderstanding.

952
01:18:11,357 --> 01:18:13,773
The game is over for good.

953
01:18:13,775 --> 01:18:14,773
Okay.

954
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:15,773
Where's Savannah?

955
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:16,730
Savannah!

956
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:17,939
This has gone on long enough!

957
01:18:17,941 --> 01:18:19,230
Tonight this is over.

958
01:18:19,232 --> 01:18:21,230
There will be no more Jurassic Games.

959
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:23,023
Okay, Laura, what are you, stop, what are you doing?

960
01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:23,939
This is crazy.

961
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:24,855
Jeff.

962
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:25,773
Are you serious?

963
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:26,814
I've known you 10 years.

964
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:27,689
Are you kidding me?

965
01:18:27,691 --> 01:18:28,648
What is happening right now, are you crazy?

966
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,648
You're going in.

967
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,480
What?

968
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:31,314
No!

969
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:32,148
Stop!

970
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:32,980
Stop it right now!

971
01:18:32,982 --> 01:18:33,815
Stop it!

972
01:18:46,566 --> 01:18:47,605
Brian.

973
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:49,900
If I don't call off that T-Rex, it will kill him.

974
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,730
You're not gonna shoot me.

975
01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:58,898
Bring it to me live, now.

976
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,023
It's over, everyone.

977
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:01,564
It's over.

978
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:04,855
Now watch this evil piece of shit learn his lesson.

979
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:05,855
Back to the desert.

980
01:19:05,857 --> 01:19:06,690
Do it!

981
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,314
Okay.

982
01:19:20,316 --> 01:19:21,689
Alright.

983
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:23,189
Come on baby, make it good.

984
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,650
Let's fucking go!

985
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:38,689
We all know by now

986
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:40,230

988

Pessoas de todo o mundo ainda estão de luto

989
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,855
a morte do amado host.

990
01:21:46,857 --> 01:21:49,148
Foi trágico, com certeza.

991
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,980
Mas, você sabe o que eles dizem.

992
